*coBra.txt*   Plugin that forces brackets and quotes to be smart

[co]erced [bra]cket


coBra runs in insert and visual modes only, default pairs are "'`{([.
coBra works by buffer and more precisely by file type. Be sure to have the
|filetype| option on (you can check it with `:filetype`, and look for
"detection:ON"). This way coBra uses the corresponding set of pairs if
available (defined with |g:coBraPairs|). If not, he falls back to the default setting.

coBra maps for insert mode <BS>, <CR> and the two characters of each
pair.
For visual mode one map for each opener characters prefixed by <Leader> is
created. He expects that no mapping for these keys already exists.
If not, the concerned mapping will fail.

All settings are optional.

                                                                *g:coBraPairs*

You can customize the pairs. If the open character is the same as the close
character the pair is considered as quotes (different behavior on some
situation compared to brackets). You have to enter a set of pairs by
file type. Of course you can customize the default set too.
Only one restriction, a pair is composed of two characters max.

  let g:coBraPairs = {
    \  'default': [
    \    ['"', '"'],
    \    ["'", "'"],
    \  ],
    \  'rust': [
    \    ['"', '"'],
    \    ['<', '>'],
    \    ['{', '}'],
    \    ['(', ')'],
    \    ['[', ']']

                                                   *g:coBraMaxPendingCloseTry*

Preformance is king when we type. For that reason you can set
|g:coBraMaxPendingCloseTry| to a scpecific value between 0 and
|maxfuncdepth|, default 10. When you type an openning bracket, before
inserting and auto closing it the script looks recursively for a "pending"
close bracket that does not have a matching open one. If it find one the
script simply inserts the open bracket without auto closing it to complete the
pair. |g:coBraMaxPendingCloseTry| limits the number of try of this logic.

                                                           *g:coBraFullBuffer*

By default, and for the sake of performance, coBra takes into account only the
visible lines from the current window. With this option you can configure
coBra to run on the entire file.

Like |g:coBraFullBuffer| but instead of the whole file, you can set a range
of lines (starting from the cursor position, forward and backward).
